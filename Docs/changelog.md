## [2026-02-25] - Auth Pages Design Improvements

### Added
- **Google Logo**: Integrated Google logo asset in `LoginPage.xaml` and `SignUpPage.xaml`.

### Changed
#### LoginPage.xaml
- **Google Button**: Replaced standard `Button` with `Border` control matching design (white stroke, rounded corners, Google icon).
- **Entry Fields**: Wrapped Email and Password entries in `Border` controls for rounded corners matching design mockup.
- **Logo**: Changed from single `Label` to `HorizontalStackLayout` for two-tone effect.
- **Login Button**: Replaced standard `Button` with `Border` control for styled text spans.

#### SignUpPage.xaml
- Updated to match `LoginPage.xaml` design and architecture:
    - Wrapped `Entry` controls in `Border` for consistent styling.
    - Updated Logo to use `HorizontalStackLayout` for two-tone effect.
    - Updated Sign Up and Google buttons to use `Border` style for consistent branding.

### Fixed
- Entry fields now have proper rounded corners as per design specification.
- Logo text now visually distinguishes "inno" vs "music" portions.
